# Compiler Phases Implementation in Python using ANTLR

This repository contains a simple implementation of all six phases of a compiler using the Python programming language.

## Compiler Phases Covered

- Lexical Analyzer  
- Syntax Analyzer  
- Semantic Analyzer  
- Intermediate Code Generation  
- Code Optimization  
- Code Generation  

Each phase is implemented separately in Python.

## Use of AI Tools

Modern AI-assisted tools such as **ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition)** and **ChatGPT** were used to:

- Understand compiler design concepts  
- Define grammar rules for lexical and syntax analysis  
- Automatically generate lexer and parser logic  
- Debug and refine Python programs  
- Improve code structure and clarity  

The core compiler phases were implemented , while ANTLR was explored as a modern AI-assisted compiler tool.
