# AI Tool Used: ANTLR

ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a modern AI-assisted
tool used to automatically generate lexical analyzers and syntax
analyzers from grammar rules.

In this project, ANTLR was used to define grammar rules for a simple
programming language and automatically generate lexer and parser logic.

The core compiler phases were implemented from scratch in Python to
understand internal working, while ANTLR was explored as a modern
tool for compiler automation.
