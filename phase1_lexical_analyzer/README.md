## Phase 1: Lexical Analyzer

This phase performs lexical analysis, which is the first phase of a compiler.

The lexical analyzer reads the source code and converts it into tokens such as
keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, and separators.

The purpose of this phase is to remove unnecessary characters (like spaces)
and convert the input program into a sequence of meaningful tokens
that can be used by later compiler phases.

**Language Used:** Python
