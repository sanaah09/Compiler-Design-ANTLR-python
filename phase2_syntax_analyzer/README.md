## Phase 2: Syntax Analyzer

This phase performs syntax analysis, which is the second phase of a compiler.

The syntax analyzer checks whether the sequence of tokens generated by the
lexical analyzer follows the grammatical rules of the language.

In this phase, a simple grammar is used to validate expressions of the form:

    identifier = identifier operator identifier

If the input follows the grammar, it is considered syntactically correct.

**Language Used:** Python
